SECTION 1: Open Refine and Spreadsheet


Pro
•	Good step by step instructions
•	The OpenRefine slot was very useful. I would have wanted to know more about other functionalities available in the menu. It is possible to merge or concatenate
•	Thank you very much Lucia. I never got the email to prepare for the session. Would be great to have it before the workshop
•	Helps a lot having helpers and sticky note system is efficient
•	Presenter very clear and understandable
•	I enjoyed the session a lot! Learnt a lot. 
•	OpenRefine is new to me and it works awesome!
•	It felt pretty amazing when things started working
•	Presentation was clear and humours 
•	So happy you used social science derived data
•	Very helpful hints
•	Interactive and very well presented
•	Good content, well thought, lot of helpers
•	Help is available
•	Enjoy using openrefine
•	A great know to learn how to use  Openrefine to extract the data which are useful for the research
•	Good and clear discussion of excel best practices and open refine. Very useful
•	Assistants are great very helpful and patient
•	Hands on session
•	I really like everything. It is very detailed and the instructor and helpers explained very patiently. Thank you! The content seems so useful
•	Useful information on how to best organise data
•	Very good support from the helpers with any issues


Negative and things to improve
•	Open refine not working on my pc
•	Maybe we should not have spent so much time on excel and more on Open refine. The metadata is something to see how actually to record. It was a little bit general
•	Pace at times when demonstrating something new was too quick
•	Nothing. Good presentation. I was able to follow all the way
•	Nice to have the etherpad but could I be used more to show sintax and exercises
•	Just wish the things were a little slower on the beginning though I managed to catch up now
•	When using a new file please give couple of seconds to get the file
•	Using syntax was a little bit confusing
•	Not easy to follow examples, maybe leave question on the screen
•	Screen is not big enough. Hence sometimes is hard to follow the instruction, especially for learning new things

•	More exercise time for Open refine less time for data organisation in spread sheet
•	Very hard to follow the codes used in Open refine keep the screen up/make sure its viewable by the audience


SECTION 2: R Studio

Pro
•	Excellent presentation by Justin! Very clear
•	Interesting. Good progression
•	Fruitful and practical. Interesting tutor, I love the exercises
•	The exercises were really good. It was good to get some practice and make sure that we all understand the concepts
•	Very helpful exercises (e.g. the pipeline ex.). Lots of help available during the exercises
•	Really loved it and happy to have been introduced to these new concepts
•	Justin is great
•	Very interesting stuff. Very powerful tool
•	Thank you Justin. Even though it was fast the quality of the material is excellent. We just need time to process the info
•	Absolutely awesome! All important and practical hints/functions
•	Very good presentation
•	Great energy and friendliness. Very helpful, open and patient with everyone. Very knowledgeable, yet still open to learning from feedback from those in class who may have known new methods
•	Very energetic and enthusiastic. Excellent content with great script files
•	Maybe organise online courses


Negative and things to improve
•	Helper wasn’t able to answer my question. Ended up asking me to look up online. But it is alright
•	Instructors chatting during the presentation. Maybe wait until lecturer has finished? It is a little bit distracting
•	Too fast at the end, maybe cut out ggplot rather than rush through and sticking to basics function and have a more advance lesson separately. 
•	It would have been good to have more time with ggplot2
•	More time for ggplot
•	Tight schedule. Need better time control. Need more emphasis on visualisation
•	Less time on smaller easier exercise and more time on the visualisation
•	Nothing
•	Had to skip through a coy at the end. Maybe just give notes?
•	Too much content in too little time, but great offer 
•	A bit condensed, need more time to be fully delivered

SECTION 3: SQL
Pro
•	Thank you so much to all of you who helps us during this workshop
•	I really enjoyed the course. I was amazed by how much you fitted in. Great teachers and helpers
•	Big thanks
•	Very extensive coverage of materials
•	Thank you very much for all hints on how to use these handy tools
•	Clear intro into the relational databases and the basis of keys
•	A relief to go a bit slowly at first after the R session
•	Very useful and practical exercises, really provide a sense of what we are doing with the software
•	Very good thanks
•	Everything explained clearly
•	Good intro to SQL
•	Exercises are a good way to consolidate concepts but it would have been nice to be able to visualise both the code and the exercise question
•	Patient tutor. Practical course structure


Negative and things to improve
•	Probably could not be avoided, but last part of SQL was too fast/ confusing. Maybe go to table construction and joins just after the coffee break
•	Perhaps I am too tired. I was lost half a way through
•	Short on time on interesting topics
•	I would have like more time to practice
•	Got confused at the end
•	It would have good to have a whole day on R rather than having R in the morning and SQL in the afternoon
•	I feel like there could have been a whole day on SQL
•	Got lost at the end on the join part.
